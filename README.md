This waveform illustrates the behavior of a state machine as it detects the "101" pattern in the input sequence. The clock signal `clk` continues to oscillate, and the reset signal `rst_n` remains high, indicating that the state machine is running without being reset. The input signal `in` changes between high and low levels, and the state machine detects the occurrence of the "101" pattern based on these inputs. When the state machine successfully detects "101," the output signal `Y` goes high, occurring at 65ns, 105ns, 135ns, and other points, marking successful recognition of the target pattern. At the same time, the sequence counter `count_101` increments at these time points, increasing from 0 to 4 sequentially, recording the number of successfully detected "101" patterns. The pause signal `pause` remains low throughout, indicating that the state machine is not paused. During the entire process, the state machine effectively detects multiple occurrences of the "101" pattern from the input signal, with the changes in the output signal and counter clearly indicating the state machine's operational status and detection results.
